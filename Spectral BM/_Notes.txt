- Addon #19 stopped working after the Astromancer patch. I don't know if someone found out a way to mod that.

- Addon #20 already includes #02. Remove #02 first if you're gonna use it, and then apply only #20 instead.

- There are 2 addons that move F to LMB. Both work.

- The numbered addons were made by me (Galla).

- Credits to Teravisor for "bm3spec_swordfall_to_LMB" and "BM3spec_Cyclone_to_C"
